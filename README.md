Just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Alto Knights and I gotta say, it’s a mixed bag, dude. Like, it had these crazy intense moments, and then outta nowhere, they throw in this weird comedy bit and I’m just sitting there like “seriously, what the heck?!” But, like, the costumes are chef's kiss, you know what I mean? I was eyeing those boots the whole time, wondering if they’d get mad if I paused just to sketch them... but too lazy to actually hit pause lol.

And that lead guy... totally aware he's got that broody charm down, but, UGH, he had these lines that belong in a Hallmark card. I’m thinking, who writes this stuff?? Movie writers just throw words at a wall and see what sticks, I swear.

> Also, who knew this was a mafia-themed movie?? Like, I was under the impression it was a 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern day Roma thing, had no idea it'd be drive-bys and cheap suits. But yeah, next time you should definitely 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie— kinda wanna see what you think about the plot twist near the end. Plot twist or plot hole, you be the judge, haha.

So, I'm definitely gonna need some caffeine after this marathon of mood swings. Like, my character arc needs coffee, you dig me?

if (mood === confused) return dessert;

Yeah, honestly dude, let’s get together and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie again. Sometimes those bizarre moments get better with company, or maybe we just end up roasting it the whole time. Either way, it’ll be a blast. Catch ya later!
